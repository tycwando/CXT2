# CXT2 CHANGELOG

### Version [1.0.0] | [7-14-2025]

## General 
- Updated client sided state machine to be more responsive to the client.
- Entirely recoded the movement in contrast to the prior update.

 ## Bug Fixes
- Aerial movement no longer is as clunky as it was before. 
- Momentum properly works and can conserve any move in the game, instead of it being as awkward as it was before.
- DeltaTime no longer fucks up the entire movement system, now reliably has the same outcome at any fps.

## Additions | Reworks
- Rescripted A-ni-ki
- Added a 4 frame jump squat and 4 frame landing to every character. (As of Version 1.0.0)


## Notes [7-14-2025]
The main problem I had with A-ni-ki was the fact that I couldn't properly express his characteristics whilst adding new mechanics in the game which entirely counteract how he should/would play with them. So, I decided to fully redo the character and make him more focused on how he would work with the game's mechanics as opposed to adding them in as an afterthought to his pre-existing kit.
