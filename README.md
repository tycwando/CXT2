# CXT2 CHANGELOG
Version 0.001 10-20-2025 VANILLA SEASON 0

ー General ー

Redid the entire framework of the game, mainly so I can read it properly.
The main problem was that the prior framework was practically unreadable(?) and had a lot of problems.

 ー Movement ー

Movement has been properly optimized and is once again character dependent. 
Reverted back to Humanoid movement until I properly recode character movement. 
This entails a future update; currently, I am attempting to hasten the long pause in time between this and prior update.

ー UI ー

Entirely reworked UI. I decided to make a proper UI Framework from scratch, being very easy to do so though what I've learned
as of late.

I've added more selectable options such as character types and deselection methods from certain points in character selection,
reducing the amount of resets required.

 ー Combat ー

WORK IN PROGRESS.
Will be updated as I finish a majority of it.

 ー Networking ー

Slightly reverted the netcode and severely optimized it.
The code now includes BYTENET influence, allowing for faster, more secure connection between client and server information.

 ー ETC ー

k.iw.i did  something major.
mrrp.     meow

 Comments 
I severely apologize for the incomprehensible delay between this and prior update for cxt2. I promise, I have been working verily and deligently! I will not disappoint, hopefully.
