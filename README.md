# CXT2 CHANGELOG

### Version [1.0.0] | [8-19-2025]

## General | Main Additions
- Optimized the character selection screen.
- Severely cut on data sent
- Added an on-screen keyboard that displays your current keystroke-based inputs !! they are very handy and the visual looks cooler !!
- Updated UI to be more interactive and cool.
- Movement options are now character dependent.
- You can now lock onto the target by pressing V and hovering your mouse over the target. This can be disabled by pressing it a second time.
- Properly made hurtboxes independent to the character and can now generate hurtboxes that extend where you can hit the stated player.


 ## Bug Fixes
- Aerial movement no longer is as clunky as it was before. 
- Momentum properly works and can conserve any move in the game, instead of it being as awkward as it was before.

## Reworks
- Redid A-ni-ki
- Redid Kaguya Ishida
- Redid Seon Yul
- Redid Fiona (Alter)

## Notes [7-14-2025]
The main problem I had with A-ni-ki was the fact that I couldn't properly express his characteristics whilst adding new mechanics in the game which entirely counteract how he should/would play with them. So, I decided to fully redo the character and make him more focused on how he would work with the game's mechanics as opposed to adding them in as an afterthought to his pre-existing kit. 

## Notes [7-21-2025]
With the addition of character specific movement, I've also been contemplating on removing dashes for certain characters and giving them different movement options. I'll think more about that later on.

## Notes [8-19-2025]
Redid formatting. I also changed the information to be a little more organized instead of feeling like rambles and are more direct.
A few issues with the game's development is that I didn't have a direction and now I am more solidified in foundation. I am still however shaky in the character design aspect, though, it will get better with time.
Thank you for being so patient as always, now onto the actual topic of this note being that I wanted to add a lot of characters before I rereleased this game.
A few changes I have made to the game will ensure that interactions are the primary prorogative instead of combos. Combos felt as if they were plaguing my mind as opposed to the game being an actual FIGHTING game... and moreso became a combo game. I have diverged from that idea, finding that promoting interactions between players is infinitely better than having long combos. Though, characters will still have them, it'll require proper time and setup for you to effectively combo the target. 
Defensive mechanics should also properly weave within the design of the character, instead of being made after a character's been made. So, I will create characters based around these mechanics in mind beforehand instead of creating mechanics after the fact to balance out that character. This simply causes a mess and it's not exactly pleasant for me.
The period of time it took to make this update has been vast unfortunately but I do believe it is a must since I wouldn't want to make a game that's bad in my eyes.
