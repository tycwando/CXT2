# CXT2 CHANGELOG

## Version 1.0.0

### General
 updated client sided state machine to be more responsive to the client.
 entirely recoded the movement in contrast to the prior update.

 ### Bug Fixes
 aerial movement no longer is as clunky as it was before. 
 momentum properly works and can conserve any move in the game, instead of it being as awkward as it was before.
 deltaTime no longer fucks up the entire movement system, now reliably has the same outcome at any fps.
